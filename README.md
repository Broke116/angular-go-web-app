# Angular-go-web-app
Developing web app based on microservice approach using Angular, GO, Docker and Mongodb

This repository is used for learning Angular and GO by developing a microservice based application. MongoDB will be used for Database. GO api and the database parts of our application are linked. Then the frontend side of the application which will be developed by using Angular will be added to docker-compose file to run all of them altogether.
Docker will be used for containerization of the application.

Any helpful recommendations and pull requests to this application will be welcomed
